Civil society is essential to governance, especially where laws and authority are weak.
We study how a core strategy of international civil society groups—-informing and publicizing
human rights abuses—-impacts those tied to abuse. Our study focuses on a major
trend at the center of on-going international media campaigns: the assassination of civil
society activists involved in mining activity. Collecting and coding 20 years of data on
assassination events, we use Event Study Methodology to study how publicity of these
events impact the asset prices of firms associated with abuse. We show that publicizing
abuses has a significant impact on multinationals. Firms associated with an assassination
have large, negative abnormal returns following the event. We calculate a median loss in
market capitalisation of over 100 million USD, ten days following violence. We highlight
the role of media publicity in our results. We show negative returns from assassinations are
stronger during periods of low media pressure, versus when they coincide with competing
newsworthy events. As well, we argue our results are driven by events where companies
are explicitly named in media publicity, using a set of placebo events where no firms were
identified by news coverage. Furthermore, we reject that our results are driven by other
forms of unrest and conflict. Last, we show activist assassinations are positively related
to the royalties paid by firms to domestic governments.
