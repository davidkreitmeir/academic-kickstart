Civil society and free media are key constraints to corporate misconduct. Our study explores the stock market's reaction to attempts to suppress civil activism in the global natural resource sector. We collect new data on hundreds of extra-judicial assassinations of environmental activists of the past 20 yearsâ€”and the publicly traded mining companies associated with these events. Applying event study methodology, we show that the extra-judicial killing of activists leads to significant negative abnormal returns for mining companies tied to violence. For these companies, the median loss in market capitalisation is over 100 million USD, ten days following the event. We show that media coverage plays an important role in these effects: negative returns are stronger during periods of low media pressure versus when assassinations coincide with newsworthy events. We further show that the negative impacts of assassinations are not driven by other forms of civil unrest. Finally, we find tentative evidence that the occurrence of assassinations is positively related to the royalties paid by firms to domestic governments.
