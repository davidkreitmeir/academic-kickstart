Civil society is seen a key ingredient to political and economic development. Our
study explores the consequences of suppressing civil society. We do so by analyzing
market responses to a severe form of repression: the extra-judicial assassinations of
activists in resource-rich economies. We conduct an event study using hundreds of
rare, hand-coded records of activist assassinationsâ€”including the names of
implicated companies. We implement our unique, large-scale asset price study, by
creating firm-level measures of "exposure" to violence and comparing the cumulative
abnormal returns (CARs) across firms differentially exposed to events. By analyzing
outcomes before and after violence, we answer two questions: 1) Examining asset
price movements prior to killings, we test for whether markets reveal prior
knowledge of violence. 2) Our main analysis then explores asset price movements
after assassinations to investigate investor responses to violence. We find extrajudicial killings lead to highly significant negative abnormal returns for companies
associated with violence. These effects are also highly persistent. Next, using the rich
global reach of our study, we explore how market reactions vary by measures of
institutional quality. We show the extent to which firms face repercussions from
violence is significantly related to the quality of state institutions. Thus, our findings
indicate that markets punish firms most likely to benefit from the suppression of civil
society, though less so under weak states.
