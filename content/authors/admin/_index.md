I am currently a PhD Candidate at Monash University after receiving my BSc and MSc in Economics from the University of Munich (LMU).
My research interests include Political Economy, Applied Econometrics, and Civil conflict & Human Right Violations.
<!--- My current projects aim to contribute to a better understanding of the role of institutions in the context of human rights violations. --->

I enjoy applying modern ML and High Dimensional methods to answer empirical questions and extract novel datasets from text corpora.
